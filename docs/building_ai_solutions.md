## User Research for AI

User research (UR) is critical to AI project success and provides key insights into human behavior, thinking, and feelings.

### Why UR Matters for AI

- Keeps human in the loop
- Understands human intelligence that AI will replicate/imitate
- Observes how people complete tasks and solve problems
- Uncovers cultural issues impacting AI adoption
- Identifies where and how humans need involvement

### AI-Specific UR Activities

**Understanding if AI is Right Tool:**
- Early UR to observe people in processes
- Help understand user problems and aspirations
- Establish baseline metrics for project outcomes
- Work out appropriate model accuracy levels
- Understand biases in existing human processes

**Defining Performance Metrics:**
- Work with analytical colleagues
- Use research insights to define model and system metrics
- Develop methodologies for measuring ongoing performance

**Preparing Data:**
- Understand what data users use and how they think about activities
- Help find, categorize and summarize training data
- Assist with supervised learning requiring human judgement for labeling
- Consider bias effects on labeling

**Synthesizing Data:**
- Review and assess appropriateness of generated synthetic data
- Develop processes for bringing subject matter experts into loop
- Check UK Statistics Authority guidance on synthetic data ethics

**Evaluating Model Output:**
