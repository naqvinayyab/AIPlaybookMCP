# Principles

## Overview

The 10 core principles guide the safe, responsible and effective use of artificial intelligence (AI) in government organisations. These build upon the 5 principles from the white paper *A pro-innovation approach to AI regulation* and define specific guidance for AI use in government and public sector organisations.

## The 10 Principles

### Principle 1: You know what AI is and what its limitations are

AI is a broad field subject to rapid research and innovation. You should learn about AI technology to understand what it can and cannot do, and the potential risks it poses.

**Key Points:**
- AI systems currently lack reasoning and contextual awareness
- Limitations vary depending on tools and context
- AI systems are not guaranteed to be accurate
- Understand how to use AI tools safely and responsibly
- Employ techniques to increase accuracy and correctness
- Have testing processes in place

**References:** See [Understanding AI](./02_understanding_ai.md) section for detailed capabilities and limitations.

### Principle 2: You use AI lawfully, ethically and responsibly

AI solutions bring specific legal and ethical considerations. Your use must be lawful and responsible.

**Requirements:**
- Seek legal advice on development and use of AI
- Engage with compliance, legal and data protection experts early
- Consider equalities implications, fairness, intellectual property issues
- Seek data protection advice from lawyers or DPO
- Address ethical concerns throughout project lifecycle
- Consider bias and harmful outputs from training data
- Ensure positive impact on stakeholders while minimising harms
- Conduct user research and engage with public appropriately
- Manage environmental impact
- Use AI only when relevant, appropriate and proportionate

**References:** See [Using AI Safely and Responsibly](./05_using_ai_safely_responsibly.md) section.

### Principle 3: You know how to use AI securely

AI services must be secure and resilient to cyber attacks, complying with Government Cyber Security Strategy.

**Requirements:**
- Comply with Secure by Design principles (CDDO)
- Meet government's Cyber Security Standard
- Understand AI-specific security risks (data poisoning, perturbation attacks, prompt injections, hallucinations)
- Build in safeguards and technical controls
- Implement security testing and content filtering
- Use validation checks to ensure accuracy and prevent data leaks

**References:** See [Security](./08_security.md) section.

### Principle 4: You have meaningful human control at the right stages

Monitor AI behavior and have plans to prevent harmful effects on users.

**Requirements:**
- Ensure humans validate high-risk AI-influenced decisions
- Have strategies for meaningful intervention
- For instant-response applications (chatbots), ensure human control at other development/deployment stages
- Fully test products before deployment
- Maintain robust assurance and regular checks of live tools
- Have systems for users to report issues and prompt human review
- Incorporate user feedback mechanisms

**References:** See Human oversight section in [Data Protection and Privacy](./07_data_protection_privacy.md).

### Principle 5: You understand how to manage the full AI lifecycle

AI solutions have a complete product lifecycle requiring proper management.

**Requirements:**
- Know how to choose the right tool
- Set up and maintain day-to-day operations
- Update systems appropriately
- Securely close down at end of life
- Monitor and mitigate drift, bias, and hallucinations
- Have robust testing and monitoring processes
- Use Technology Code of Practice
- Understand NCSC cloud security principles
- Consider government-wide applications and knowledge sharing
- Use government Service Standard for service development

**References:** See [Building AI Solutions](./03_building_ai_solutions.md) section.

### Principle 6: You use the right tool for the job

Select the most appropriate technology to meet your needs.

**Considerations:**
- AI is good at many tasks but there are various models and products
- Be open to AI solutions for new/faster service delivery approaches
- Consider AI for creative policy thinking and time-consuming tasks
- Sometimes AI is not the best solution - established technologies may be more appropriate
- Select appropriate deployment patterns and models for your use case

**References:** See Identifying use cases sections in [Building AI Solutions](./03_building_ai_solutions.md).

### Principle 7: You are open and collaborative

Leverage existing cross-government communities and engage with wider civil society.

**Requirements:**
- Use cross-government communities (AI community of practice)
- Engage with other departments addressing similar issues
- Reuse ideas, code and infrastructure where possible
- Engage with civil society, NGOs, academic and public representative organisations
- Be transparent about AI use in official duties
- Use Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard (ATRS) where required
- Clearly identify automated responses (e.g., "written by an automated AI chatbot")

**References:** See Ethics section in [Using AI Safely and Responsibly](./05_using_ai_safely_responsibly.md).

### Principle 8: You work with commercial colleagues from the start

Get specific commercial advice due to AI's rapidly developing market.

**Requirements:**
- Reach out to commercial colleagues early
- Understand how to use AI in line with commercial requirements
- Ensure same responsible/ethical expectations for in-house and procured AI
- Draft contracts requiring transparency from suppliers (e.g., ATRS requirements)

**References:** See [Buying AI](./04_buying_ai.md) section.

### Principle 9: You have the skills and expertise needed to implement and use AI solutions

Understand technical and ethical requirements and have appropriate team capabilities.

**Skill Requirements:**
- Technical skills for using, designing, building and maintaining AI solutions
- Different skills needed for bespoke AI vs pre-trained models via APIs
- Decision maker and SRO understanding of risks and opportunities
- Knowledge of organizational culture, governance, ethics and strategy impacts
- Continuous learning through Civil Service Learning AI courses
- Track developments in the field proactively

**References:** See Acquiring skills and talent section in [Building AI Solutions](./03_building_ai_solutions.md).

### Principle 10: You use these principles alongside your organisation's policies and have the right assurance in place

These principles provide consistent UK government approach but must work with organizational policies.

**Requirements:**
- Follow organization-specific policies (especially security and data handling)
- Understand, monitor and mitigate AI risks
- Connect with assurance teams early in project lifecycle
- Have documented review and escalation processes
- Establish AI review board or programme-level board

**References:** See [Governance](./09_governance.md) section.

## Implementation Notes

- Print posters available for each principle to display in government organizations
- Principles work together - consider interactions and trade-offs
- Regular review needed as AI technology evolves
- Training resources available through Civil Service Learning
