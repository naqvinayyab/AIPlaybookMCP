# Legal Considerations

## Overview

Different AI types and use cases create different legal issues. You should seek advice from government legal advisers who can help navigate AI design and use in government.

**Key Point:** Many legal issues surrounding AI are not new. Ethical principles (fairness, discrimination, transparency, bias) have sound foundations in public and other law. Ethical issues your team identifies are likely legal issues lawyers can guide you through.

## When to Engage Legal Advisers

Contact your legal team when you can explain:
- Your aims for the AI solution
- What it will be capable of doing  
- Any potential risks you're aware of

This helps understand if you need legislation to achieve your goals and minimizes risk of:
- Work being challenged in court
- Unintended and/or unethical consequences
- Negative impact on people you want to benefit

## Example Legal Issues

*Note: These are designed to help understand when to consider legal advice. They should not be read as actual legal advice. Application depends on specific facts. Always consult your organisation's lawyer.*

### Data Protection

Data protection is a legal issue with potentially serious consequences if government gets it wrong.

**Key Points:**
- Your organization likely has a data protection officer
- May have data protection experts in your team
- Legal team can help unpick difficult AI-created data protection issues

**Reference:** See [Data Protection and Privacy](./07_data_protection_privacy.md) section for detailed information.

### Contractual Issues

Your lawyers help draw up contracts and agreements for AI tool procurement or licensing.

**Special Considerations:**
- How to deal with intellectual property
- Ensure transparency level needed for buyers to understand systems
- Transfer projects to new or successor suppliers
- Assist with defense against legal challenges

**Technology Service Contracts:**
- May need procedures for system errors and outages
- Recognize potential consequences of performance failures
- Consider appropriate contractual terms early
- May drive decisions on appropriate route to market

**Reference:** See [Buying AI](./04_buying_ai.md) section for procurement information.

### Intellectual Property, Including Copyright

Potential intellectual property issues with AI have been much discussed. Lawyers can help navigate these.

**Consider at Outset:**
- Which parties will own which parts of IP generated during project
- Which parties will have ongoing rights to use generated IP (and on what basis)  
- How balance of risk and liability should be determined between parties
- Relevant to claims for infringement of third party intellectual property

### Equality Issues

Lawyers can help navigate equality issues raised by AI use in government.

**Key Areas:**
- Obligations under Equality Act 2010
- Public Sector Equality Duty requirements
- Conducting equality impact assessments of AI use
- Guard against bias (particularly important in AI context)

**Early Legal Engagement Benefits:**
- Help ensure government fulfills responsibilities to public
- Assess technology impacts before contracts are signed
- Ensure compliance with equality obligations

### Public Law Principles

Public law principles explain how public bodies should act rationally, fairly, lawfully and in compatibility with human rights.

**Overlap with Ethical Principles:**
- Many principles overlap with ethical guidance in this playbook
- Lawyers can guide application based on public law knowledge
- Court cases and judgment details provide specific guidance

**Key Public Law Areas:**

**Procedural Fairness**
- Not about decision reached but how decision is arrived at
- Transparency and explainability of AI tools key to demonstrating fair procedure
- Inability to determine AI decision-making may introduce risk

**Rationality**
- Relevant in testing AI system choice
- Consider features used in system
- Consider outcomes and metrics used to test outcomes

**Decision Making Context**
- Consider if particular decision should be delegated to decision maker rather than AI automated decision
- Regulated environments (procurement) could be subject to legal challenge if procedural fairness, lack of bias, and rationality cannot be evidenced

### Human Rights

Public authorities must act compatibly with human rights.

**AI Impact on Rights:**
- AI systems (especially those using personal data) may affect individual rights under European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)
- Most likely impacted rights:
  - Article 8: Right to private and family life
  - Article 10: Freedom of expression

**Legal Obligations:**
- Must ensure AI systems don't violate human rights
- Consider human rights implications throughout AI development and deployment
- Assess potential impact on individual rights and freedoms

### Legislation

Sometimes public authorities need legislative framework to do something. Lawyers can advise whether AI use is within current legal framework or needs new legislation.

**Potential Legislative Issues:**
- Legislative framework might not allow process automation to be delegated to machine
- Framework might provide for decision to be made by particular person
- May need specific legal authority for certain AI applications

**Examples:**
- Automated decision-making powers
- Data processing authorities
- Regulatory enforcement capabilities

## Practical Recommendations

### Early Legal Engagement
- Ensure you engage legal professionals at AI project outset
- They can help navigate legal complexities
- Identify potential legal risks associated with:
  - Data protection
  - Contractual agreements  
  - Intellectual property
  - Equality issues
  - Public law principles compliance

### Data Protection Focus
- Given potential consequences of mishandling personal data
- Collaborate with legal experts to ensure data protection regulation compliance
- Understand how to mitigate risks associated with data privacy and security

### Robust Contract Development
- Work with legal experts to develop robust contracts and agreements
- For procuring or licensing AI tools consider:
  - Intellectual property rights
  - Transparency levels
  - Liability distribution
  - Procedures for addressing system errors or failures

### Legislative Compliance
- Seek legal advice to determine if AI project aligns with existing legislative frameworks
- Determine if new legislation required
- Understanding legislative constraints helps mitigate legal challenge risk
- Ensures compliance with legislative requirements

### Risk Mitigation
- Legal engagement helps identify and mitigate potential legal risks
- Reduces likelihood of court challenges
- Ensures ethical and responsible AI development
- Protects individuals and organizations from legal consequences

### Documentation and Evidence
- Maintain clear documentation of legal advice received
- Document decision-making processes and legal considerations
- Ensure ability to demonstrate compliance with legal requirements
- Prepare evidence for potential legal challenges or audits
