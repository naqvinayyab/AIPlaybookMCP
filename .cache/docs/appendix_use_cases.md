Appendix: example AI use cases in the public sector 

This section includes sample case studies provided by teams that have implemented AI solutions in government departments and public sector organisations. These are real-life examples of AI adoption, presenting the technologies that were deployed, reflections on their capabilities and shortcomings, and discussions of the challenges and risks encountered in each project. 

Be aware that these case studies were submitted in spring 2024 and only discuss the aspects of AI projects that each team deemed most relevant and interesting. They are not exhaustive and should not be treated as formal advice. You can find guidance in the Building AI solutions section of this playbook.

You’re encouraged to share your AI project with the [AI community of practice](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/communities/artificial-intelligence-community) to be considered for future updates of this appendix. This will also enable the community to connect you with the teams that have developed similar projects in other departments so that you can share expertise and best practice.
