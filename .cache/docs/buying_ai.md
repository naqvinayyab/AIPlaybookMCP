Buying AI 

While AI is not new, the AI supply market is evolving rapidly. It’s important that you engage with commercial colleagues to discuss partners, pricing, products and services.

The Crown Commercial Service (CCS) can guide you through:

-   existing guidance
-   routes to market
-   specifying your requirements
-   running your procurement

They can also help you navigate:

-   running your procurement in an emerging market
-   regulation and policy
-   aligning procurement and ethics

AI business cases 

Creating the business case for your AI project is an important stage in the process of AI adoption as it gives decision makers the opportunity to assess the return of investment in both resources and costs.

Before writing your business case, you should engage with stakeholders and discuss your project to understand if AI needs to be used, and, if so, which solutions offer the best improvements in productivity.

There are several resources you can use to write a strong business case. Consider following the Treasury’s [Green Book (2022)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-green-book-appraisal-and-evaluation-in-central-government/the-green-book-2020) guidance to create a fully fledged, five-part business case. This may be a requirement depending on the scale of your project and investment.

Your organisation will likely have investment thresholds. Typically, any investment approaching £10 million will require a five-part business case. You must use the Green Book when that is the case. If the scale of investment is below this threshold, you should strongly consider using the guidance on [agile business cases](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agile-digital-and-it-projects-clarification-of-business-case-guidance/agile-digital-and-it-projects-clarification-of-business-case-guidance), which was developed by the Government Digital Service (GDS).

When working on your business case, note that it’s mandatory to assure all digital and technology spend above £100,000 for anything public facing and £1 million for anything else, through your assurance boards. The process for doing so will be subject to your organisation’s requirements. Follow GDS’s [guidance on getting spend approvals](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-and-technology-spend-control-version-6).

In the following section, we summarise existing guidance on purchasing AI products and services. However, as the field is evolving rapidly this is not exhaustive, and engaging with commercial experts early in your project remains crucial.

Existing guidance

There is detailed guidance to support the procurement of AI in the public sector. You should familiarise yourself with this guidance and make sure you’re taking steps to align with best practice. The:

-   [Guidelines for AI procurement](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidelines-for-ai-procurement) provide a summary of best practice when buying AI technologies in government, including [preparation and planning](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidelines-for-ai-procurement/guidelines-for-ai-procurement#preparation-and-planning), [publication](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidelines-for-ai-procurement/guidelines-for-ai-procurement#publication), [selection, evaluation and award](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidelines-for-ai-procurement/guidelines-for-ai-procurement#selection-evaluation-and-award) and [contract implementation and ongoing management](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidelines-for-ai-procurement/guidelines-for-ai-procurement#contract-implementation-and-ongoing-management)
-   [Digital, Data and Technology Playbook](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-digital-data-and-technology-playbook) provides general guidance on sourcing and contracting for digital and data projects and programmes. All central government departments and their arm’s length bodies are expected to follow this on a ‘comply or explain’ basis. It includes specific guidance on AI and machine learning, as well as Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
-   [Sourcing Playbook](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-sourcing-and-consultancy-playbooks) defines the commercial process as a whole and includes key policies and guidance for making sourcing decisions for the delivery of public services
-   [Knowledge asset management in government (The Rose Book)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/knowledge-asset-management-in-government) provides guidance on managing and exploiting the wider value of knowledge assets (including software, data and business processes). Annex D contains specific guidance on managing these in procurement
-   [Digital and technology spend control version 6](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-and-technology-spend-control-version-6/digital-and-technology-spend-control-version-6) details in which instances your requirements will be subject to functional assurance of central government spending. Spend controls enable the UK government to achieve greater efficiency and better outcomes
-   [Procurement Policy Note (PPN) 02/24: Improving Transparency of Artificial Intelligence Use in Procurement](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ppn-0224-improving-transparency-of-ai-use-in-procurement) provides optional questions to help identify suppliers’ use of AI in response to government procurements and in the delivery of services to government

Routes to market 

Consider the available routes to market and commercial agreements and determine which one is most suitable based on your requirements. 

However you decide to source your requirement, you must ensure you comply with procurement legislation. This is primarily the [Public Contract Regulations 2015](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/102/contents/made) and the [Procurement Act 2023](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/54/contents/enacted), which is set to come into effect in 2025. Commercial colleagues will be able to assist with this.

There are various routes to market to purchase AI systems. Depending on the kind of challenges you’re addressing, you may prefer to use a [framework](https://www.crowncommercial.gov.uk/news/what-is-a-framework-procurement-essentials) or a [Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS)](https://www.crowncommercial.gov.uk/news/what-is-a-dynamic-purchasing-system). CCS offers several frameworks and DPSs for the public sector to procure AI.

A [public-sector procurement](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/public-sector-procurement) route also exists, sometimes known as a ‘Find a tender service procurement’ due to the requirement to advertise on that platform. This may be appropriate for bespoke requirements or contractual terms, or where there is no suitable standard offering.

The table below summarises the differences between a framework agreement and a DPS. There’s more information on the [CCS website](https://www.crowncommercial.gov.uk/) and, on the use of frameworks, in the [Digital, Data and Technology Playbook](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-digital-data-and-technology-playbook).

| Category | Framework | DPS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Supplier access | Successful suppliers are awarded to the framework at launch.  
  
Closed to new supplier registrations.   
  
Prime suppliers can request to add new subcontractors. | Open for new supplier registrations at any time. |
| Structure | Often divided into lots by product or service type. | Suppliers filterable by categories. |
| Compliance | Thorough ongoing supplier compliance checks carried out by CCS, meaning buyers have less to do at call-off (excluding G-Cloud). | Basic compliance checks are carried out by CCS, allowing the buyer to complete these at the call-off. |
| Buying options | Various options, including direct award, depending on the agreements. | Further competition only. |

Note that a number of CCS agreements include AI within their scope.

Examples of DPSs include:

-   [Artificial Intelligence (AI)](http://www.crowncommercial.gov.uk/agreements/rm6200)
-   [Automation Marketplace](http://www.crowncommercial.gov.uk/agreements/rm6173)
-   [SPARK](http://www.crowncommercial.gov.uk/agreements/rm6094)

Examples of frameworks include:

-   [Big Data and Analytics](http://www.crowncommercial.gov.uk/agreements/rm6195)
-   [Technology Products & Associated Services 2](https://www.crowncommercial.gov.uk/agreements/RM6098)
-   [Technology Services 3](https://www.crowncommercial.gov.uk/agreements/RM6100)
-   [Back Office Software](https://www.crowncommercial.gov.uk/agreements/RM6194)
-   [Cloud Compute 2](https://www.crowncommercial.gov.uk/agreements/RM6292)

In addition to commercial agreements, CCS has signed a number of [Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with suppliers](https://www.crowncommercial.gov.uk/products-and-services/technology/technology-memorandum-of-understanding/). These MoUs set out preferential pricing and discounts on products and services across the technology landscape, including cloud, software, technology products and services, and networks. You can access MoU savings through any route to market. To get support or find out more, email [info@crowncommercial.gov.uk](mailto:info@crowncommercial.gov.uk). 

Specifying your requirements 

When buying AI products and services, you’ll need to document your requirements to tell your suppliers what you need. To define what you need, you should engage with subject matter experts (SMEs) as soon as possible, and take time to consider the most appropriate type of AI solution for your project. This might be an off-the-shelf product, an existing technology with bolt-on AI elements (paid or free), outsourcing AI builds (if applicable), or co-creating AI with suppliers. The [Digital, Data and Technology Playbook](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-digital-data-and-technology-playbook) has guidance on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software licensing terms and build versus buy decisions.

When drafting requirements for AI, you should:

-   start with your problem statement
-   highlight your data strategy and requirements
-   focus on data quality, bias (mitigation) and limitations 
-   underline the need for you to understand the supplier’s AI approach
-   consider strategies to avoid vendor lock-in
-   apply the [Data Ethics Framework principles](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-ethics-framework/data-ethics-framework) and consider the appropriate [Data ethics requirements and questions (PDF, 62.7KB)](https://assets.crowncommercial.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/Data-ethics-requirements-for-suppliers-template.pdf)
-   mention any integration with associated technologies or services
-   consider your ongoing support and maintenance requirements
-   consider data format and provide suppliers with dummy data where possible
-   provide guidance on budget to consider hidden costs
-   consider intellectual property rights and who will have these if new software is developed
-   consider any acceptable liabilities and appetite for risk, to match against draft terms and conditions, once provided

For more information, read the ‘Selection, evaluation and award’ section of the [Guidelines for AI Procurement](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidelines-for-ai-procurement/guidelines-for-ai-procurement#selection-evaluation-and-award) and CCS’s guide on [How to write a specification](https://www.crowncommercial.gov.uk/news/how-to-write-a-specification-procurement-essentials).

Having prepared your procurement strategy, defined your requirements and selected your commercial agreement, you can proceed with your procurement. Your commercial team will lead this. 

If you’re using an existing commercial agreement such as a framework or DPS, you’ll conduct a call-off in accordance with the process set out in the relevant commercial agreement. Non-framework or DPS procurements must comply with procurement legislation and relevant policy – for example, the [Public Contract Regulations 2015](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/102/contents/made), the [Procurement Act 2023](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/54/contents/enacted) and PPNs. 

CCS offers buyer guidance tailored to each of its agreements, which describe each step in detail, including completing your order contract and compiling your contract.

Running your procurement in an emerging market Commercial agreements

While AI is not new, it is an emerging market from a commercial perspective. As well as rapidly evolving technology, there are ongoing changes in the supply base and the products and services it offers. DPSs offer flexibility for new suppliers to join, which often complement these dynamics for buyers. 

Any public sector buyers interested in shaping CCS’s longer term commercial agreement portfolio should express their interest by emailing [info@crowncommercial.gov.uk](mailto:info@crowncommercial.gov.uk).

Regulation and policy

Regulation and policy will also evolve to keep pace. However, there are already a number of legal and regulatory provisions which are relevant to the use of AI technologies. These include:

-   [A pro-innovation approach to AI regulation: government response](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/ai-regulation-a-pro-innovation-approach-policy-proposals/outcome/a-pro-innovation-approach-to-ai-regulation-government-response#introduction): this details the government’s response to the white paper consultation published in March 2023, which set out early steps towards establishing a regulatory regime for AI, including 5 principles to guide responsible AI innovation in all sectors
-   [Portfolio of AI assurance techniques](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cdei-portfolio-of-ai-assurance-techniques): this portfolio has been developed by the Responsible Technology Adoption Unit (RTAU), initially in collaboration with [techUK](https://www.techuk.org/). It’s useful for anybody involved in designing, developing, deploying or procuring AI-enabled systems. It shows examples of AI assurance techniques being used in the real world to support the development of trustworthy AI
-   [Introduction to AI assurance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introduction-to-ai-assurance/introduction-to-ai-assurance): this guidance has been developed by the Department for Science, Information and Technology (DSIT) to help private sector organisations better understand how to implement AI assurance to ensure the responsible development and deployment of AI systems. It’s designed to be accessible to a range of users, especially those who may not engage with assurance on a day-to-day basis. It introduces them to core assurance definitions and concepts and then how these can be applied to support the development and use of trustworthy AI
-   AI Management Essentials: DSIT is developing guidance to support private sector organisations to engage in the development of ethical, robust and responsible AI organisational practice. This self-assessment tool will distil key principles from existing AI-related standards and frameworks and provide simple baseline requirements for government suppliers of AI products and services. After testing and consultation, DSIT is planning to work with the Cabinet Office to embed the tool in government procurement frameworks

This list is not exhaustive. For further guidance, refer to the Legal considerations section.

Aligning procurement and ethics 

It’s important to consider and factor data ethics into your commercial approach from the outset. 

There’s a range of [guidance relating to AI and data ethics](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/data-ethics-and-ai-guidance-landscape) to support public servants working with data and/or AI. This guidance collates existing ethical principles, developed by government and public sector bodies. You can also refer to the:

-   [Data ethics framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-ethics-framework/data-ethics-framework): this outlines appropriate and responsible data use in government and the wider public sector. The framework helps public servants understand ethical considerations, address these within their projects, and encourages responsible innovation
-   [Data ethics requirements checklist (PDF, 62.7KB)](https://assets.crowncommercial.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/Data-ethics-requirements-for-suppliers-template.pdf) for suppliers: this will mitigate bias. It will also ensure diversity in development teams, transparency and interpretability, and explainability of the results
-   [Public Sector Contract (PSC)](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/the-public-sector-contract): this includes provisions related to intellectual property rights, data protection, and equality, diversity and human rights

Practical recommendations

-   Engage your commercial colleagues from the outset. Understand and make use of existing guidance.
-   Understand and make use of existing routes to market, including frameworks, DPSs and MoUs.
-   Specify clear requirements and plan your procurement carefully.
-   Seek support from your commercial colleagues to help navigate the evolving market, regulatory and policy landscape.
