Principles 

We have defined 10 common principles to guide the safe, responsible and effective use of artificial intelligence (AI) in government organisations. The white paper [A pro-innovation approach to AI regulation](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-regulation-a-pro-innovation-approach/white-paper) sets out [5 principles](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-regulation-a-pro-innovation-approach/white-paper#annex-a-implementation-of-the-principles-by-regulators) for regulators to inform AI development in all sectors. This playbook builds on those principles and defines 10 core principles for AI use in government and public sector organisations.

-   Principle 1: You know what AI is and what its limitations are
-   Principle 2: You use AI lawfully, ethically and responsibly
-   Principle 3: You know how to use AI securely
-   Principle 4: You have meaningful human control at the right stage
-   Principle 5: You understand how to manage the AI life cycle
-   Principle 6: You use the right tool for the job
-   Principle 7: You are open and collaborative
-   Principle 8: You work with commercial colleagues from the start
-   Principle 9: You have the skills and expertise needed to implement and use AI
-   Principle 10: You use these principles alongside your organisation’s policies and have the right assurance in place

You can find [posters on each of the 10 principles](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-playbook-for-the-uk-government) for you to display in your government organisation.
